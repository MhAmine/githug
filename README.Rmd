Wrap yourself in the warm embrace of Git from the comfort of R.

### githug

This package facilitates common Git tasks by gluing together features from [git2r](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r) and [gh](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/gh), with special attention to things you can't do with RStudio's Git client.

I teach "data analysis with R". Alot, often under time constraints, with students running Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. But they all have perfectly functional R/RStudio setups! I like to touch on Git and GitHub, but hate to get bogged down in Git-related [command-line bullshittery](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm). `githug` lets us stay in R/RStudio for as long as possible, while still using Git and GitHub.

### Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/githug")
```

### Usage

*write this*

### How does `githug` fit into existing landscape?

  * RStudio's Git client has a few gaps that hurt
    - cannot create a branch
    - cannot set up anything remote
    - can only set up connection to a remote under narrow circumstances (when cloning from GitHub -- which is why we advocate a "GitHub first" workflow in STAT 545); leads to wistful staring at greyed out Pull and Push buttons otherwise
  * [`gh`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/gh) package from Gabor Csardi is a very thin wrapper around the GitHub API
    - user must read API docs to figure out what's possible and then deduce syntax for a `gh` call
    - no native vectorization
  * *[`rgithub`](https://github.com/cscheid/rgithub/) is another GitHub API wrapper, but seems less suitable as a low-level thing to wrap than `gh`*
  * [`git2r`](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/) from Stefan Widgren / rOpenSci wraps libgit2, so in theory exposes almost anything you can do from Git via command line
    - default arguments and argument order can be improved, e.g. automatic determination of repo
    - heavy use of S4 objects
  * [`hub`](https://hub.github.com) command line wrapper for GitHub. Note that the [`gh`](https://github.com/jingweno/gh) command line client has been merged into `hub`.
  * [`gitlabr`](http://gitlab.points-of-interest.cc/points-of-interest/gitlabr/issues/): new, nice wrapper around the gitlab API from Jirka Lewandowski. Dual = high level and low level.

#### Stuff I want to provide

  * ~~Global config~~
    - ~~user.name~~
    - ~~user.email~~
  * Repos
    - ~~init~~
    - ~~discover~~
    - ~~status, log, etc etc~~
    - branch
  * Authentication stuff: set up, query, modify
    - turn on keychain for HTTPS people
    - help set up SSH keys and configure ssh-agent?
    - get and stow PAT for GitHub API
  * Remotes
    - list
    - add
    - delete
    - rename
  * Interact with GitHub repos
    - visit in a browser: `hub browse`
    - create: `hub create karthik/foo` will create a new repo on my github account called foo, add it as remote and push the current branch
    - clone, fork
    - delete
    - create, delete, track branch
    - push and pull
    - update a fork
  * GitHub API
    - help user figure out what's possible? make this table Gabor and I talk about over in `gh` and put to good use here?
    - expose fxns to do at least all the stuff I've done via the API
    - use `dplyr`/`tidyr`/`purrr` to `tbl_df`-ize and tidy output and vectorize on input?
  * Is Git installed? What version? Where does Git appear to be? Is it on the `PATH`?
